# SCF Public Goods Maintenance Working Group

## Welcome

This GitHub organization serves as the central hub for the community-driven effort to design, build,
and govern sustainable funding and maintenance mechanisms for public goods in the Stellar ecosystem.

Public goods — open-source tooling, libraries, explorers, RPC infrastructure, SDKs, and other
non-rivalrous, non-excludable resources — are foundational to Stellar's long-term resilience and
developer velocity. The working group is focused on evolving the existing Public Goods Award into a
mature, data-informed, and decentralized program that reduces systemic risks (e.g., pony factor
failures) and accelerates Soroban adoption.

## Public Goods Award

The SCF Public Goods Award supports the ongoing maintenance, security, documentation, and incremental
evolution of public goods that are broadly beneficial to the Stellar/Soroban ecosystem.

- [Public Goods Award Process and Rules](public-goods-award.md)

The working group is piloting an enhanced decentralization round in 2026 to transition the quarterly
Public Goods Award toward a hybrid retroactive + maintenance retainer model. Read more about the
rationale and the success criteria of this experiment:

- [2026 Q2 Award Round](pg-award/2026q2-award-round.md)

## Public Goods Atlas

PG Atlas is the objective metrics backbone that aims to provide transparent, verifiable signals for
funding decisions. Key components include dependency graphing, transitive criticality scoring, pony
factor analysis, and an interactive dashboard.

Architecture and technical specification:

## Working Group Consensus & Vision

The core vision, purpose, outcomes, and open questions are captured in the living consensus document:

- [Public Goods Maintenance Working Group Overview](pg-working-group.md)

This document represents the preliminary and evolving agreement among active contributors (including
Pilots, maintainers, and SDF observers) as of early 2026. It's a snapshot of a source document that
is still accepting edits, last updated on 2026-01-16, and may not represent the latest consensus.

## Get Involved

This is a community-led initiative. All discussions remain open to SCF Pilots in the Stellar
Developers Discord:

- Maintenance of Public Goods - Working Group
- Pilots are especially encouraged to review, comment, and contribute via PRs in this git repo.

Repository contributions follow standard GitHub flow. Issues and discussions are enabled for async
input.
