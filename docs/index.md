# SCF Public Goods Maintenance Working Group

## Welcome

This GitHub organization serves as the central hub for the community-driven effort to design, build,
and govern sustainable funding and maintenance mechanisms for public goods in the Stellar ecosystem.

Public goods — open-source tooling, libraries, explorers, RPC infrastructure, SDKs, and other
non-rivalrous, non-excludable resources — are foundational to Stellar's long-term resilience and
developer velocity. The working group is focused on evolving the existing Public Goods Award into a
mature, data-informed, and decentralized program that reduces systemic risks (e.g., pony factor
failures) and accelerates Soroban adoption.

## Working Group Consensus & Vision

The core vision, purpose, outcomes, and open questions are captured in the living consensus document:

- [Public Goods Maintenance Working Group Overview](/pg-working-group.md)

This document represents the preliminary and evolving agreement among active contributors (including
Pilots, maintainers, and SDF observers) as of early 2026. It's a snapshot of a source document that
is still accepting edits, and does not represent the latest consensus.

## Public Goods Award (2026 Experiments)

The working group is piloting an experiment in 2026 to transition the quarterly Public Goods Award
toward a hybrid retroactive + maintenance retainer model:

- **Public Goods Award beta on Tansu** – Decentralized proposal intake, NQG-weighted voting, and
anonymous voter participation.

Detailed design, voting mechanics, and NQG integration:

- [Public Goods Award Experiment Specification](/public-goods-award.md) *(under active development)*

## Public Goods Atlas (Metrics Backbone)

PG Atlas is the objective metrics layer that aims to provide transparent, verifiable signals for
funding decisions.

Key components include dependency graphing, transitive criticality scoring, pony factor analysis,
and an active subgraph projection.

Architecture and technical specification:

## Get Involved

This is a community-led initiative. All discussions remain open to SCF Pilots in the Stellar
Developers Discord:

- Maintenance of Public Goods - Working Group
- Pilots are especially encouraged to review, comment, and contribute via PRs in this git repo.

Repository contributions follow standard GitHub flow. Issues and discussions are enabled for async
input.
